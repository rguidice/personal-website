<p>Hi, I am <b>{{ site.author.name }}</b>.</p>

<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

<p>I am currently a fourth-year computer engineering student at Colorado State University.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to serve as a hub for my professional and personal endeavors. You can checkout some of my past projects and whatever I'm currently working on down in the Projects section.</p>

<p>I have experience with Python, Java, C/C++, Verilog/SystemVerilog, UVM, HTML/CSS, batch and bash scripting, assembly, Matlab and Git. My current workflow mainly uses the Atom text editor, along with Eclipse for Java development and Anaconda for big Python projects. I have also used Quartus Prime and Quartus II for logic design, Keil uVision for ARM microprocessor assembly development and the Windows deployment kit, WinPE and Hyper-V for Windows image capture and deployment.</p>

<p>I also have experience using Wordpress and Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and Lightroom for creative endeavors.</p>

<p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy soccer, photography/videography, and working on personal projects (such as this site).</p>
