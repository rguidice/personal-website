# Smart Blinds Machine

This purpose of this project was to create a machine that could control a set of blinds via a web frontend. This was achieved using a Raspberry Pi 3B, a stepper motor, and a photoresistor.

The project featured a web interface to control the blinds, designed by my partner [Andrew Helmreich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhelmreich/). It also had an autocontrol feature that used the photoresistor to detect light levels outside, then adjust the blinds accordingly. This allowed the blinds to automatically open themselves in the morning and close at night.

This project was completed as part of CS370 at Colorado State University. My partner and I's full paper has much more information about our development process, design decisions, and product cost analysis.
