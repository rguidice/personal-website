# Building a MagicMirror:
### A Fun Project and Cool Gift
<br>
Back in high school, I was lucky enough to take a class every year with a fantastic teacher. This teacher had arrived at our school when I was a freshman, and a group of my fellow students and I were very fortunate to get to know this amazing teacher over the years and grow up with her guidance.

When it came to senior year, it was discussed multiple times in class how sad she would be to see us go when we graduated. Wanting to thank her for her many years of assistance, advice and care, one of my best friends and I decided we wanted to build something for her that she could keep in her classroom to remember us by.

As noted in other projects on this site, I have always had an extreme admiration for the [MagicMirror project](https://magicmirror.builders/) by Michael Teeuw. After seeing some very cool completed versions of mirrors on his [blog](https://michaelteeuw.nl/), I decided this would be an excellent gift to give to our teacher.

We started by ordering a Raspberry Pi 3, installing the MagicMirror package onto it and configuring a basic setup for it. Next, we ordered a used monitor off of Ebay, so we had something to drive the MagicMirror output to. Once the monitor arrived, we stripped down all of the plastic housing around it and kept just the panel, display controller and power components. Once measurements were taken, I ordered a piece of one-way acrylic mirror from [TAP Plastics](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/two_way_mirrored_acrylic/558) that would be reflective on the front and serve as a mirror, but also allow the light from the monitor to shine through the back. Once all of these components arrived and were ready, it was time to start working on a wooden frame to house it all.

The majority of the credit for the wooden housing has to go to my grandfather, who put together an amazing frame that not only perfectly fit the monitor and acrylic panel, but also had room for the Raspberry Pi and power inputs. To top it all off, he even designed the back panel in such a way that it was modular enough to easily access most of the internal components without disassembling the entire frame. I was blown away by the level of craftsmenship that was put into the frame design, and am certainly very grateful to have such an awesome grandfather.

After the wooden housing was done, I put some finishing touches on the MagicMirror build by adding a module to the bottom that included my teacher's favorite quotes. I also ordered a custom plaque to go on the side, commemerating the mirror's creation.

Overall, this was an incredibly fun project and ended up being a great gift. I learned a lot about physical design considerations while building it, and am very happy with how the final product turned out.
