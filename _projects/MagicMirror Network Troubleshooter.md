description: Written as a series of bash scripts, this troubleshooter helps a MagicMirror user restore network connection if it fails on boot. This was designed with my "Building a MagicMirror" project in mind. It was created to continue support of the gift by managing WPA2 Enterprise network configuration, something that is not trivial on the Raspberry Pi 3B.
