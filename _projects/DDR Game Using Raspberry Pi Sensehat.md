description: Teaching my little brother Python with a DDR-style game using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT. Used the HAT's 8x8 LED matrix and joystick to make a game flashed an arrow in a random direction (up, down, left, or right), then gave you an amount of time to correctly flip the joystick that direction, awarding you a point. The amount of time is based on the selected difficulty.
